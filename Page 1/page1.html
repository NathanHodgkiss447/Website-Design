<p>Hi, my name is Nathan and I am a first-year student at the National College of Ireland. I have a passion for anything to do with technology hence, why I was keen on the idea of creating a website that review’s consumer level hardware. It has been a hobby of mine for years to research what the latest “flagship” phone/graphics card/ laptop is like, and compare them to their competitors, which is why I thoroughly enjoyed creating and maintaining this website.
     My other hobbies include: reading, gaming & rugby.

<p>Hello, my name is Piyush and I am also a first-year student at the National College of Ireland.
	some of my hobbies are football, gaming and fitness. Another hobby of mine is researching on latest technology and the development of technology.
I always wanted to create a website, to help people who do not know much about the latest tech, purchase new technology without being scammed. I have been scammed way to many times.
This is the reason I was interested in the idea of   E-reviews and enjoyed every minute we spent creating it and maintaining this website. </p>
